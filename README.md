The package SymmetricFunctions encodes the most standard symmetric functions basis (elementary, complete homegeneous, power sum, monomial and Schur) 
and their associated polynomials. The changes of basis between symmetric functions and the operation of plethysm is also implemented. 
Many associated combinatorial tools are present in this package (Young Tableaux, Littlewood Richardson coefficients, Kostka coefficients ...). 
A significant part of the algorithms is actually borrowed and adapted from the packages of Per Alexandersson https://github.com/PerAlexandersson?tab=repositories

This package is necessary for the packages BrauerAlgebra and xBrauer to work properly.
